# Fizzbuzz

An introduction to Ruby and Rspec testing.

Write a simple program that you can run from the command line and return "Fizz" if a number is divisible by 3, "Buzz" if a number is divisible by 5, and "Fizzbuzz" if a number is divisible by 15.

To view the tests, run;

```sh
$ rspec
```

To play with Fizzbuzz in the command line;

```sh
$ fizzbuzz.fizzbuzz_says(number)
```
